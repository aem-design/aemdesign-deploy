# /etc/containers/registries.conf
# /run/containers/registries.conf

# This is a system-wide configuration file used to
# keep track of registries for various container backends.
# It adheres to YAML format and does not support recursive
# lists of registries.

# The default location for this configuration file is /etc/containers/registries.conf.

# The only valid categories are: 'registries', 'insecure_registies',
# and 'block_registries'.

registries:
  - docker.io


# If you need to access insecure registries, uncomment the section below
# and add the registries fully-qualified name. An insecure registry is one
# that does not have a valid SSL certificate or only does HTTP.
insecure_registries:
  - {{ docker_registry }}
  - {{ docker_registry_address }}:{{ docker_registry_mirror_port }}
  - {{ docker_registry_address }}:{{ docker_registry_group_port }}

# If you need to block pull access from a registry, uncomment the section below
# and add the registries fully-qualified name.
